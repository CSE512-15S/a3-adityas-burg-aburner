## Project: Patch Pipeline

TODO: Put your a brief description of your final interactive visualization application and your dataset here.

TODO: add BSD license

## Running Instructions

Access our visualization at http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-adityas-burg-aburner/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

TODO: explain how to use the visualization here (as well as on the page itself).

If you put your work online, please also write a [one-line description and add a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from the CSE512-15S page.

## Story Board

TODO: Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here. Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.
